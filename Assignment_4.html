    <h1>Famous Places of Pakistan</h1>
    <h3>
      <u>Shalimar Garden</u>

      Completed in 1641, the Shalimar Gardens were the possession of a noble,
      Pakistani family, a governance not difficult to guess at all, considering
      the magnificence of this beautiful site. The gardens are laid out over
      three descending, successive terraces carrying the poetic names of
      Bestower of Pleasure, Bestower of Goodness and Bestower of Life, each
      rising four to five meters above the other. Despite the ravishing flowers
      and lush fruit trees, the flora isn’t the best attraction of these
      gardens, as the misleading name might suggest. In fact, most striking are
      the large pools placed in the middle of the terraces, which receive water
      from hundreds of fountains (410 in total across the three terraces). The
      quaint pavilions, porticoed audience halls and marble basins found along
      the edges of the pools complete a peaceful, dream-like and refreshing
      corner in the city of Lahore.

      <u>Faisal Mosque</u>

      When Turkish architect Vedat Dalokay‘s design was chosen for the Faisal
      Mosque, many raised their eyebrows. The project differed from traditional
      mosque architecture, as it featured contemporary, sleek lines and, most
      notably, lacked a dome. Construction work began in 1976 and was finally
      completed ten years later. By then, most criticism had crumbled in front
      of the imposing, captivating building that now dominates Islamabad,
      Pakistan’s capital city, from its elevated position at the foot of the
      Margalla Hills. The mosque is named after Faisal bin Abdul-Aziz, the Saudi
      king who suggested the idea of a national Pakistani mosque, and largely
      financed its construction. The 5,000-square-meter prayer hall is an
      eight-sided, concrete structure, inspired by the traditional tents of
      Bedouins, with a capacity for 100,000 worshippers. It’s surrounded by four
      88-metre-high minarets in perfect one-to-one ratio with the base. They
      were designed as the sides of an imaginary cube, in honor of the sacred,
      cubic Kaaba found at the centre of Mecca’s most important mosque.

      The Pakistan Monument was inaugurated in Islamabad on 23 March 2007 as a national monument embodying the country’s history, and is in effect rich with significant cultural references. For its design, architect Arif Masood drew inspiration from the figure of a blossoming flower to represent the four provinces and three territories into which Pakistan is subdivided. The structure consists of four bigger ‘petals’ (the provinces), alternated with three smaller ones (the territories), built in granite and decorated with murals on the inner sides. Seen from above, the monument meaningfully recalls the five-pointed star on Pakistan’s national flag. Below the petals, a metallic crescent is found, which is inscribed with verses by Pakistan’s founder Muhammad Ali Jinnah and Indian poet Muhammad Iqbal.

      <u>Tomb Muhammad Ali Jinnah</u>

      Widely revered as the Great Leader or Father of the Nation throughout Pakistan, Muhammad Ali Jinnah was a pivotal figure in leading the country to independence from the British Empire. A beautiful mausoleum in Karachi, Pakistan’s largest city and Jinnah’s hometown, celebrates his memory and is home to his tomb, as well as those of his sister and Pakistan’s first prime minister. The mausoleum’s bold design impresses with its striking yet iconic simplicity: a nearly cubic base, with an extension of 75 square meters, topped by a large dome, both clad with splendid white marble. The sanctum can be entered on any of the four entrances, one on every wall, and each situated under an eye-catching Moorish arch. Jinnah’s tomb lies on an elevated platform rising in the middle of the stunning surrounding park, with beautiful moans and a set of 15 successive fountains that lead the eye towards the mausoleum.
